# lake_problem_demo
this is a demo for solving multi-objective optimization using MORDM (Kasprzyk et al., 2013). A simplified lake problem is solved using MOEA+DPS in python (using Platypus &amp;Rhodium developed by David Hadka). For further details, please refer to Julianne Quinn's orinigal paper in 2017 (tipping point). Some changes are made to the scripts by Antonia Hadjimichael for training purposes.
